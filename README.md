<p>Create a simple page to pull out shifts for current day, determine if that shift is related
with any time clock and display them in simple HTML table. Use PHP (version 7+
recommended), and Humanity API. You can use both of our API versions. Using
frameworks/libraries is also acceptable, but not necessary. </p>


<p>Steps:
Create a trial account on http://www.humanity.com/
Send an email address of the admin (user) account to hr@humanity.com so we can
enable API access.
After confirmation from our side that the API access has been granted go to
http://www.humanity.com/app/admin/api/ and obtain an API key.
